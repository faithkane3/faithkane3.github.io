# Welcome to faithkane3.github.io

## This repo contains the notebooks that I am hosting to share with others. I hope you find them useful; I've enjoyed the process of learning through notebook creation so much!

## Pages

1. /notebook_tutorial1

>This notebook will show you how to install and use Nbextensions, use lot of exciting markdown code, and walk you through creating and using Github Pages to host your own notebooks as html.

2. /stats_review

>This notebook covers Probability Distributions and Hypothesis Testing. I tried to make the concepts approachable and included lots of helpful examples and code snippets.

3. /regression_review

>This notebook covers the Linear Regression data science pipeline in full, from start to finish. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline.
