# Welcome to Faith Kane's Github Page

## This repo contains the notebooks that I am hosting to share with others. I hope you find them useful; I've enjoyed the process of learning through notebook creation so much!

/stats_review

>This notebook covers Probability Distributions and Hypothesis Testing. I tried to make the concepts approachable and included lots of helpful examples and code snippets.
