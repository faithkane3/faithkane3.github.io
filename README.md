# Welcome to Faith Kane's Github Page

## This repo contains the notebooks that I am creating to share with others. I hope you find them useful. I've enjoyed the process of learning through notebook creation so much!

## Pages

[HTML Notebook Tutorial](https://faithkane3.github.io/notebook_html_tutorial)

>This notebook will show you how to install and use Nbextensions, use lot of exciting markdown code, and walk you through creating and using Github Pages to host your own notebooks as html.

[SQL Review Notebook](https://faithkane3.github.io/)

COMING SOON!

>This notebook introduces SQL as a tool to interrogate databases and acquire data for use with python libraries like numpy and pandas. It will cover everything from basic queries using a single table to subqueries that involve joining tables and data filtering.

[Pandas Review Notebook](https://faithkane3.github.io/)

COMING SOON!

>This notebook introduces the pandas library from Series objects to DataFrame objects including their common attributes, methods, and chaining techniques that employ both allowing for creative data manipulation.

[Stats Review Notebook](https://faithkane3.github.io/stats_review)

>This notebook covers Probability Distributions and Hypothesis Testing. I tried to make the concepts approachable and included lots of helpful examples and code snippets.

[Linear Regression Review Notebook](https://faithkane3.github.io/regression_review)

>This notebook covers the Linear Regression data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline.

[Classification Review Notebook](https://faithkane3.github.io/classification_review)

>This notebook covers the Classification data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline.

[Time Series Review Notebook](https://faithkane3.github.io/time_series_review/time_series_review)

>This notebook is a work in progress. It will cover the Time Series data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. At this point, it covers a high-level overview of the topic, a couple of ways to acquire time series data to practice with, and some techniques for preparation and exploration of the data. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline.
